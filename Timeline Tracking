Using this to keep track of when changes were made and what

April 14, 2022
- Changed the tournament so that the popbest isn't being accidentally overwritten if there are multiple values that are tied
- Added parameters to the fitness function to keep track of:
  1. How much vegetation was consumed by M1 and M2
  2. What moves were made by each player
  3. How much is in each field at any given point
  
  This is being used in order to analyze the overall data and see trends
